      <h2>FUTURE THOUGHTS</h2>
      <p>My future seems to be bleak, like a hollow space. I stare into the void as I recollect my thoughts. 
        I just feel like nothing will turn out so well for me. My parents and older relatives would probably say 
        I’m just being dramatic… But I do not know what to do. Do I have the right amount of skills? Can I really 
        take care of myself? Who will I be? Will I be scarred for life? I am occupied by fear...</p>
