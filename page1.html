      <h2>PAST THOUGHTS</h2>
      <p>My thoughts are in disarray. I’m remembering my former self and my stupid moments. The time I got into 
        a fight with my parents. The time I was so desperate to make new friends. When I told a stupid joke and 
        I was the only one that ended up laughing. The time I said stupid things out of nowhere. The time I cried 
        in public. I’m so dumb. I do not know how I survived for this long. Who really am I?</p>
