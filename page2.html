      <h2>PRESENT THOUGHTS</h2>
      <p>Everything is just moving so fast. Just yesterday I felt like a carefree teen, and now I have morphed 
        into someone else. I just feel the strong urge to just do something. I need some strength, some confidence to be able to stay focused on my priorities. 
        It justâ€¦ feels as if every person my age is just more capable, more confident, more prepared to face their 
        lives. But why? Why is this happening to me of all people?</p>
